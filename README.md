# About

This **was** source code of my [homepage](https://bluepitaya.xyz), but it's now obsolete. While it was fun to built my page using qwik JS framework, soon i realized that i have to upgrade to more superior technology, that is pure HTML & CSS (with single snippet of vanilla JS). Since HTML, CSS and vanilla JS are not compiled/translated/minified in any form, you can still check source code just by visiting my page and clicking F12 ;)
