  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I like functional programming. I like strong static typing. I like clean
    code. I did something in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Scala (ScalaJS, Cats Effect, little bit of Akka)</li>
    <li>Javscript/Typescript (Vue.js, React, vanilla)</li>
    <li>C# (WPF, Desktop)</li>
    <li>PHP (CakePHP)</li>
    <li>Python (various)</li>
    <li>Java (various, some mobile games in high school)</li>
    <li>Kotlin (mobile)</li>
    <li>Ruby (fuck ruby)</li>
    <li>
      C/C++ (simple algorithm implementations and some shit projects for
      studies)
    </li>
    <li>Pascal (in primary school)</li>
    <li>SQL (MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres)</li>
    <li>HTML & CSS (xd)</li>
    <li>Bash</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I want to check out in the future: Rust, Clojure. And also write some more
    in Haskell.

    One of major aspects in programming in abstraction. Nobody could write any
    complex system without abstraction of some level. And that's what
    programmers are good at: finding patterns/similarities in problems that
    they're encountering and generalizing them. For example we have a pretty big
    set of funny anagrams like KISS, YAGNI, DRY to only name some. Here i want
    to share my own realizations that I came to while coding. They can be
    opaque, not complete, unorganized (as they come directly from my notes) or
    just plain stupid. However maybe they will prevent me for making the same
    mistakes over and over again ;)

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Golden rule: YAGNI</li>
    <li>
      Always plan before code, even simple problems can be solved way better
      when you think 1 min about them, instead of coding first solution that
      came into mind. + It is good idea to first plan what you gonna code on
      paper. It helps get bigger picture of what you are doing.
    </li>
    <li>YAGNI again</li>
    <li>
      Premature optimization is the root of all evil. First make the code work
      correctly, then work to make if faster, if really necessary. Profile
      before optimize. <i>note: i think its quote from somewhere</i>
    </li>
    <li>above is also part of YAGNI</li>
    <li>
      Aim for maximum reasonable cohesion. Ex: passing object into function
      where only one field of that object is used is unnecessary, better just
      pass that parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid function parameter drilling (passing parameter to function because
      function inside it needs that parameter). Instead use functions as
      parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
      MNF (minimal necessary force) - always try to resolve current problem by
      doing the least demanding thing
    </li>
    <li>
      write functions like A -&gt B, rather than List[A] -&gt List[B], that it:
      always do single convert function instead of collection converts
    </li>
    <li>
      start from result that you want to achieve and use mock code to see what
      preparations should you do (from abstract to implementation approach)
    </li>
    <li>dont forget about YAGNI</li>
    <li>
      - find more than 1 lib that solves same problem and pick the best one,
      dont go with "fire come first serve" approach (i hope that i got this
      idiom right xd)
    </li>
    <li>
      use traits (interfaces) instead of objects in function parameters to
      achieve better cohesion.
    </li>
    <li>
      trust yourself and dont be afraid to do crazy things, <i>note: xd?</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid compression-oriented programming.

      Quote:<br />
      Like a good compressor, I don’t reuse anything until I have at least two
      instances of it occurring. Many programmers don’t understand how important
      this is, and try to write “reusable” code right off the bat, but that is
      probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make. My mantra is, “make
      your code usable before you try to make it reusable”.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wow imagine what @up refers to... <span class="shh">it's YAGNI</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fuck purism. If you don't know how to do something "by the book", it's
      better to do anything than nothing at all. + dont doubt -&gt code (things
      will clarify later)
    </li>
    <li>Focus on one thing to implement. Don't do everything at once.</li>
  </ul>
